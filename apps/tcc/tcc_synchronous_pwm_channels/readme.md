# TCC PWM generation

This example application shows how to use the TCC to generate a 2 or 3 phase PWM signals for motor control with dead time.

## Description

TCC module is configured to generate synchronous 2 or 3 phase PWM signals with dead time. The duty cycle of the PWM signals is updated in the period interrupt handler.

### Setting up [PIC32CZ-CA80 Curiosity Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. Observe the high-side and low-side PWM waveforms on oscilloscope
3. Observe the dead time between the high side (**1us**) and the low side (**0.5us**)
4. Observe the pwm frequency to be **30 KHz**
