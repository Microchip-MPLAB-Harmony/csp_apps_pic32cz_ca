# Temperature Sensor Measurement Calibration

This example application shows how to use the ADC Peripheral library in blocking mode to convert the internal bandgap temperature to a temperature
value using the two-point factory calibration.

## Description

The example application uses Global Software trigger to start a conversion on the bandgap temperature sensor input and blocks until the conversion is complete. Once the ADC conversion is complete, the value is placed in a buffer. When the buffer is full, the averga value is calculated and this value if processed with the two-point factory calibration to achieve a +/-5% nominal die temperature value in degrees C which is printed to the serial terminal.

### Setting up [PIC32CZ-CA80 Curiosity Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable


## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. The demo application will print the meausured and compensated temperature value to the serial terminal:
