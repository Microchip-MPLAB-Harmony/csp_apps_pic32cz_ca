# ADC Blocking

This example application shows how to use the ADC Peripheral library in blocking mode to convert analog input on a ADC channel

## Description

The example application uses Global Software trigger to start a conversion on a ADC channel input and blocks until the conversion is complete. Once the ADC conversion is complete, it reads the ADC count value, converts it into analog voltage and prints it on the serial terminal.

### Setting up [PIC32CZ-CA80 Curiosity Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- ADC Core 1 Channel 0 input is available on PA18 (Pin 3 of EXT1). Connect PA18 to anlog input voltage.

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. The demo application will print the ADC count and the corresponding analog voltage measured on pin PA18 (Pin 3 of EXT1):
