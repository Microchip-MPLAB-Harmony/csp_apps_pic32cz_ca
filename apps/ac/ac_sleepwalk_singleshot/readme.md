# AC Sleepwalking

This example application shows how to use the AC Peripheral library to perform a single shot comparison in standby sleep mode periodically and wake up the device when the comparator output toggles.

## Description

The negative input of analog comparator is connected to internal Bandgap voltage and the positive input is connected to internal DAC. The DAC output voltage is varied by the user. User presses 'U'/'u' to increment and 'D'/'d' to decrement the DAC output voltage. Single shot conversion is triggered by RTC compare event. Generation of a trigger and compare operation are done while the CPU is in the standby sleep mode. AC generates the interrupt when the comparator output toggles, which wakes the CPU.
