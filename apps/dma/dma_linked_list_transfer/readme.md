# DMAC linked list transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMA peripheral to copy multiple blocks of memory using DMA linked lists.

## Description

The application demonstrates transfer of data from three separate blocks of memory (defined as three separate "source" arrays) into a single block (destination array) using DMA linked lists. Three linked lists descriptors are chained together to perform the transfer. A software trigger initiates the data transfer. Interrupt is generated when the transfer is complete. Application verifies the data in the destination buffer and prints the status on the serial console.
